# Leet Movements

I watched LiveOverflows Minecraft series on YouTube and wanted to play around with Minecraft modding.

LiveOverflow wanted that people make their own hacks for Minecraft which is why he made a mod for his server that kicks players that don't move like bots.
While that's cool and all and I basically want the same thing, I want my version to be more leet.
