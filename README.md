# Leet Movements

I watched LiveOverflows Minecraft series on YouTube and wanted to play around with Minecraft modding.

LiveOverflow wanted that people make their own hacks for Minecraft which is why he made a mod for his server that kicks players that don't move like bots.
While that's cool and all and I basically want the same thing, I want my version to be more leet.

## Archival note

This mod was made for MC 1.19.2.

It may still work and even if it doesn't it's probably easy to fix but I won't do that, which is why I archived this repo.
